# oceanpack
This repository contains routines for the evaluation of data from the OceanPack sensor (_SubCtech®_).
The routines were written as part of my temporary job as a research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, working in the group of Dr. Peter Landschützer.

Basic routines will be implemented as standalone Python scripts, the evaluation of the data will mainly take place in Jupyter Notebooks.
